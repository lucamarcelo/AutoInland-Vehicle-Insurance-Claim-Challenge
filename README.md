# AutoInland-Vehicle-Insurance-Claim-Challenge
Can you predict if a client will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next 3 months?

The following represents a challenge open from 26 Marchâ€”28 June 2021 on zindi.africa. 

The data describes ~12,000 policies sold by AutoInland for car insurance. Information on the car type, make, customer age and start of policy are in the data.

The objective of this hackathon is to develop a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a claim within 3 months from their first transaction.
